## My process

1. Change background color of body
2. Add background gradient
3. Create wrapper div
4. Add arrows, questions and answers
5. Give icon sizes and styles in CSS
6. Create hover effects
7. add Javascript code to make Player answer showing responsive

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile first approach
- Flexbox
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained more practise of using Vanilla Javascript. The main challenge that I overcame was to create Js Functionality for the card. After research and practicing different ways for resolving this step, I wrote the Js code using for loop, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites interactive and dynamic.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects
